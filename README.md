  ## Description

  What is this app and what does it do:

  This app is designed for a team manager who wants to quickly assemble a development team consisting of engineers and interns. It allows she/he to input each person with their position, name, email, etc, so that the manager can quickly view all relevant contact information in one location. There is not a deployed URL. Inquirer takes in the user's input, jest tests the functions used, and an HTML file is created at the root directory as the final product.
